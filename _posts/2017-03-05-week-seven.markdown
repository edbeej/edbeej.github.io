<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week involved studying for the SWE test and working on Network Security prep for the midterm next week. I also looked into the different RESTful APIs that are out there looking a little ahead for the next project. 
<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
Currently I need to learn more about RESTful API calls and how to use those to fill in a database. I am looking into possibly using a real-time database like Firebase in our porject or maybe something simple like SQL. 

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Study study study! I have a couple of midterms next week and I will be doing a great deal of studying to try and get decent grades on all of them. I will also be looking more into SQL and getting a better understanding of the best ways to integrate RESTful API calls to a database. Looking into a tutorial website that I included in the pick of the week that has some nice tutorials into REST and how to integrate into your site.
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
So far it is still a great class but I didn't do so well in the test as I studied for a completely different type of test. Will need to re-tune my expectations of the tests and get a better understanding of what to expect.


<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
Since we are hitting project 3 and it deals with finding a RESTful API, I found a site that had a quick rundown on what REST is and how to use it, with some nice videos. [REST API Tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)
