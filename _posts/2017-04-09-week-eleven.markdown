<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week was a very busy one, esepcially with completing the project. I got a really good look at how React works and how to integrate it with our current application. Apart from the integration, I was also figuring out how to do filtering and sorting. At first I ventured down the React path but quickly realized that the filtering and sorting will take way too long if we handled it in the front end so we chose to make internal API calls to get the information we needed and to display them with React.

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
I really enjoyed integrating React with our application and seeing all the different components that are out there that can facilitate a lot of different things throughout the website. There was a component called react-infinity and react-list that I was trying to include in our project to not have to paginate but in the end I ended up creating a basic pagination option. The biggest thing in the way is truly understanding how to incorporate these different tools into the site to make it more robust.

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Next week will be spent catching up and getting ahead in my other classes. I have a couple of projects that are due next week for my other classes but towards the end I will be revisiting SWE to get the next phase of the project started.
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
Understanding the different joins has been a little of a challenge but rather interesting to try and understand how SQL works and thinks. I am looking forward to the following topics!


<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
Pretty neat little tool that can help with development, especially when you are seeing yourself hit the refresh button a lot throughout the day. This tool auto refreshes the browser when it notices a change in the filesystem, this comes in handy especially when you are editnig CSS files. [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)
