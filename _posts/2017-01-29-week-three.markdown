<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week was the first full week of school. We were introduced to our first project in SWE and I started looking into the different aspects, such as Travis CI, Python, and algorithms/data structures that may help to solving the problem. Aside from SWE I had some readings for Intro to Comp Networks and Network Security and Privacy. 

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
Currently getting a better understanding of Travis CI. It seems like it is a bit of a hassle at first to get everything working correctly. I believe I have figured out the collatz problem but just will need to optimize it to pass all the tests faster. Currently sitting at 6 seconds for each test but I think it can be much faster.

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Finish up the SWE project and learn some more about React, Docker, and get a better understanding of Travis CI. I am also in competitive programming so I will be looking at the assignment that will be assigned to maybe get a little more practice with different data structures and time efficiency.

<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
I really enjoy the class. I feel like I will be learning a lot and we are just starting. I am really glad that this class has a focus with Python because the more I use it the more interesting it seems.

<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
Another student in the class introduced my to a very useful IDE, much like Eclipse but without the hassles, slowness, or complexities that Eclipse sometimes has. The company is called [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) and they have an IDE for each language. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the python version and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the Java one. Students get the two professional versions free, try it out!
