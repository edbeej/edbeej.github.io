<h4><b>My Class Experience</b></h4>
This course has been a very rewarding experience. I have learned a great deal of different concepts that I believe will actually help me in the real world. Concepts that I knew little of, like refactoring or design patterns, that Professor Downing did a good job in introducing those topics and helping me understand them a little more. If anything, it has introduced them to me in a way that I am more confident and competent to look up more specfic questions.<br>
I think the structure of the course was pretty nice, at first it did feel more like a Python course, which was ok, but it turned into the introduction of different concepts in Python as well as a contrast to how it is in Java or the differences between the languages. Introducing concepts like SQL in Python was nice to allow me to view it from a different angle, which I think helped in understanding how the queries and structure of SQL work. <br>
One small complaint I would have on the class is the final main project. It is nice that there is a guideline as to what tools the Professor wanted you to use but it seemed to me at first a little confusing as it may not have been the best tools or best combination of those tools. I understand the reasoning behind it but maybe having it more open will allow a little more creativity from the students. <br>
Overall I will say I truly enjoyed this course and I am very glad that I took it.
