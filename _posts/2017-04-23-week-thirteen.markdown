<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week was spent finishing up the project. This entailed working with the search functionality on the front end. Had to do a little bit of REGEX to be able to find the parameters that were searched within each attribute of what was returned from the SQL query so that the found parameters could be encapsulated in a span element. We were initially thinking of doing something with the SQL query to know where the found entries were but decided to just do it on the front end once we saw that it didn't affect the speed too much.

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
There doesn't seem to be anything in the way other than the presentation which shouldn't be too difficult and getting ready for the test.

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Next week we will be spending time building the presentation that we will be doing on Friday. I will also be working on a Computer Security project that is also due on Friday.
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
This week was nice since we talked about reflection and a little more refactoring with the price class. I didn't know you could create classes from Class, by querying the class by name and invoking a new instance. It was interesting to know that creating a class instance this way will result in an Object and not an instance of that class but you can cast it.


<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
I was looking at places for Java tutorials, maybe a place that is simple and refresh a little on the basics of Java. Found a pretty nice site that is simple and fun to use called Java Ranch. [Java Ranch](https://javaranch.com/)
