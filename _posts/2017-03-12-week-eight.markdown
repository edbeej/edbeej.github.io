<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week I was mostly focusing on midterms I had in other classes. Apart from that I was looking into REACT a bit more and learning about the different APIs available. There are way too many APIs and it was a bit difficult to pick one for the project. 

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
Nothing is really in the way. Will just need to start working on the project and see what areas we will need to look into and get more proficient in. It will be a little difficult to work on it during the spring break but I will be doing what I can so that we will not feel too far behind come school after spring break.

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Next week is spring break! I will be working on the SWE project and getting the static pages set so that we can start populating it with data from the API. Apart from that I will be going to Colorado and give snowboarding a try.
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
I really enjoy the topics that we are covering in class so far. It is really helping in getting a better understanding of Python and different programming concepts. 

<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
I would assume that most if not all of us have built a website of some sort but if for some reason you feel like you need to get to the basics, there are some nice courses that are for free at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). They have other ones like algo or OS that may be able to supplement your current courses.
