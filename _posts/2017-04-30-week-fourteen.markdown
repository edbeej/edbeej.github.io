<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week we focused on getting our presentation ready for Friday and I worked on my Computer Security project. The Computer Security project was on a password cracker that would use a word dictionary to try and figure out passwords for 20 accounts using mangling of those words in the dictionary. 

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
I will definitely need to focus on SQL and design patterns. Those two are probably the bigger areas/parts of the test so I will need to learn it inside out but currently I am not feeling super comfortable with either of those topics. 

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Next week I have two finals, including SWE. I will be spending my free time studying for those exams. Aside from that I will be be trying to get everything ready around my apartment for the summer since I will be starting my internship right after the finals, so I will not have much time to get everything ready.
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
My experience of the whole class was great. I really like the different areas that were covered along the way and how the projects were divided up. I feel like I have learned a lot of python and different programming tecnhniques for programming in general and I think it will be a huge benefit getting an introduction to those concepts now for future jobs.

<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
I have been currently trying to prep for the exam and have been trying to find a nice website for design patterns, especially the ones we went over in class. I found a website that covers a good portion of them and has some more with some nice UML designs and snippets of code. [javaTpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/design-patterns-in-java)
