<h4><b>What did you do this past week?</b></h4>
This past week was spent on studying the project requirements and looking into the search functionality of the web site. Aside from reviewing the requirements of IDB3, I was working on the AES project for Computer Security and reading up on Network Security.

<h4><b>What's in your way?</b></h4>
Currently D3.js seems like a doozy but I am sure reading through the steps and how to use it with certain data sets, it shouldn't be too difficult to get it working. Search and bolding seems pretty straight forward and shouldn't hold us back too much.

<h4><b>What will you do next week?</b></h4>
Next week will be used to finish up the project. Things that will be focused will be using REGEX and javascript to bold/highlight the searched words, implementing D3.js, and ensuring that the search results are optimized to show the most relevant on top. Aside from working on the project I will also be looking into my Computer Security project and studying for a test in Building America. 
 
<h4><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></h4>
This week was rather interesting. We went into refactoring and how that would look with the different refactoring steps. I think it will be very useful for the real world the examples and how Professor Downing went through them explaining the steps so that we could get a better understanding.


<h4><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></h4>
Since we were talking about refactoring, thought it would be nice to find a useful resource for refactoring. I found this helpful website that talks about refactoring and design patterns. The premium courses cost money but there is plenty of free information to get you started. [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/)
